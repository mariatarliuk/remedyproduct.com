RPS has been able to scale up teams with the specific skill sets critical for our past and future growth as a company. We would not be in the position we are in now without the help of RPS.\""},"challengeText":"RPS needed to build the new product, while maintaining support for B6A customers on the existing platform.","solutionsTexst":"Block Six Analytics had been in development for over 4 years before engaging RPS. RPS was brought in to replace the existing legacy product with a modern, scalable solution. Our design team presented several options of how to make the product more user friendly. After the design approach was selected, the team created and executed a technical plan to transition from the outdated platform to the new solution.\nThe legacy platform was built as a monolithic PHP application; the new architecture utilized a combination of React/Redux SPA with the support of a custom backend API using Python. Technical steps involved adding initial API support to the legacy application and transitioning API’s to the new stack as product development progressed to guarantee uninterrupted service. Within 3 months RPS completely replaced the client facing functionality and moved on to admin/back office development.\n New features required Machine Learning (Media analysis platform) integration to process games and visualize on-screen sponsorship results, Social Sentiment Analysis Platform (natural language processing) for Twitter Instagram and Facebook.","results":["- Fixed the reservation system to prevent overbooking and improved scalability and performance.","- Launched web app MVP within 3 months.","- Integrated released machine learning and natural language processing suite.","- Documented and tested API use-cases using functional tests."],"businessImpactText":"Remedy worked with Block Six Analytics from 2012 through 2017.
