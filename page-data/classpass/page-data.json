The next step for our engagement was to build a robust and scalable API to support ClassPass’ new iOS native app. RPS built the API using the BDD process to ensure confidence in the API and provide the use-case documentation via functional tests.\n\nBy working closely with the mobile development team, we were able to deliver the initial MVP in three months. We continued moving away from the original web platform towards the API-centric platform, and within a year the web app was using the API to perform business functions.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015 RPS focused on supporting Classpass’ transition from a single subscription plan to a multi-tier model. RPS worked closely with the internal team to gather requirements, set expectations, and discuss architecture to ensure alignment. End-to-end implementation and testing was completed within two months, on time for the scheduled announcement date.\n\nAt the end of the work the existing users were seamlessly transitioned to their corresponding plans, supported by the new subscription model. RPS implemented a battery of functional tests to ensure the proper implementation of the use-cases; this allowed Users to seamlessly upgrade or downgrade their plans based on their needs with no interruption of service.","results":["- Fixed the reservation system to prevent overbooking and improved scalability and performance.","-  Launched mobile app MVP within 3 months.","- Transitioned from monolithic to microservices architecture, improving the long-term stability of the system","- Created architecture and released a multi-tier subscription model within 2 months.","- Documented and tested API use-cases using functional tests."],"businessImpactText":"We began working with ClassPass in 2014 after their seed round. While working with Remedy, ClassPass raised a $12M Series A in 2014 and a $40M Series B in early 2015; they raised a $30M B extension in late 2015, just after we concluded our engagement.\n\nClassPass scaled from a few US cities to serve users nationwide and in select international markets. During our 2+ year engagement the engineering team at ClassPass grew from 3 to over 30 with Remedy helping onboard and transition core team members."}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
